                It is hard to see any silver linings to the ongoing disarray
                brought by COVID-19, but for many it has meant a whole lot more
                one on one time with their pets. While schools and workplaces
                the world over remain closed, and with many people working
                solely from home since the outbreak began, it feels like a
                holiday for our four legged companions. After all, dogs cherish
                our companionship and having their favourite people by their
                side 24-7 can mean nothing but a world of fun, and the extra
                face-time will invariably strengthen the bonds between us and
                our pets. This is not without its risks however. Veterinary
                behavioural specialist Monique Feyrecilde predicts that as and
                when the world begins to lurch towards some semblance of
                normality we may see many of our pets becoming distressed or
                anxious at the sudden absence of family members from the
                homestead. Some level of separation anxiety is common in dogs
                and many people will have observed the associated behaviours
                without ever acknowledging the root. Feyrecilde notes that some
                telltale signs of separation anxiety include, “vocalizing,
                salivation, destructive behavior especially at exits like doors
                and windows, urination or defecation indoors/in unwanted
                locations, lack of appetite when alone, self-trauma like licking
                or chewing when alone, and attempted or successful escapes.” So
                what can be done? The most important thing is to prevent this
                problem before it ever has a chance to develop. Lara Shannon,
                author of Eat, Play, Love your Dog recommends introducing some
                basic independence training to make your dog more comfortable
                with its own company. The first step is to physically distance
                yourself from your dog while you are still at home (Shannon
                states that for most dogs, three to five times a day is enough
                at the start). Knowing that you are still near them but not
                physically interacting with them signals to your dog that it is
                entirely normal to be left alone sometimes, and over time this
                should effectively desensitise them to longer absences. Making
                an environment where your dog feels content and comfortable is
                also hugely important - that means all their favourite toys, a
                comfy bed and enough space to move around. The space you leave
                your dog in should be one which already has positive
                associations, i.e. a room where lots of playing and attention is
                given. Shannon also recommends changing up the way we leave the
                house regularly. Most people live by routine, and our dogs can
                pick up on this pretty quickly - so there’s a good chance that
                they recognise what grabbing car keys, putting on a jacket or
                (as we all feel compelled to do), bidding them farewell for the
                day means. Instead, try slipping out the back-door for a change.
                Go through the usual routine of leaving, then return a few
                minutes later. You could even try wearing your jacket around the
                house or lifting your car keys when moving between rooms. The
                point is avoid your dog having time to build up anxiety about
                you leaving. While separation anxiety can arise in any dog, be
                particularly cautious if you have only had your pooch for a
                short time. If your dog has mostly known a world where you are
                by their side most of the day, of course they will be thrown
                into disarray if that changes. If these behaviours do develop at
                any stage, and your dog doesn’t seem to respond to the mentioned
                methods, immediately seek help from a professional trainer or
                veterinarian.
