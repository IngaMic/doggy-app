### About
This is a single page application dedicated to dog training. On creating a profile, the user is led through the steps of filling out a questionairre about their dog and adding profile pictures.  Users can form teams/families by sending invitations to other users and track progress using a datepicker/activity log.  Users can see when other team members are online.
